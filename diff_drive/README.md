# Differential Drive

## Agent
The diff_drive agent follows a simple unicycle model for target estimation and converts the same to differential drive for control. Currently, the bot rotates to attain the desired orientation and then moves toward the goal.

## Examples

1. [Following a polygon given vertex coordinates.](../base_control.py)
2. [Detecting and seeking targets through image segmentation buffers](../base_explore.py)
